------------ May 9, 2011 --------
This is version 0.7.0 of FusionSeq. Two major changes are here introduced:
1. Use of an external configuration file (.fusionseqrc) including the parameters of the different programs and filters. This enable the distribution of binaries, instead of a compilation from scratch.
2. For those who want to compile the programs, now autoconf/automake tools make it simpler.

Please read the instructions at: http://info.gersteinlab.org/FusionSeq for more detail.
