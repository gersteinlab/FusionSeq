FusionSeq includes filters to remove spurious candidate fusions with artifacts such as misalignments or random pairing of transcript fragments and it ranks candidates according to several statistics. It also has a module to identify exact sequences at breakpoint junctions. FusionSeq detected known and novel fusions in a specially sequenced calibration data set, including 8 cancers with and without known rearrangements.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
